# 🛩️ Shared Music Player (Pilot-CoPilot Music Sync Mod)

*Fly in harmony — literally!*

This VTOL VR mod allows you to **sync your in-cockpit MP3 player with your copilot** by:
- Automatically transferring music files from the host to the joining player
- Enabling synchronized playback: **either player** can press the MP3 player's buttons (`Play/Stop`, `Next`, `Prev`) to control music for both

---

## 🚀 How it works

When the copilot enters the cockpit:
1. The mod transfers all `.mp3` files from the host’s music folder
2. The mission **pauses until the transfer is complete**, ensuring reliable syncing before takeoff
3. After syncing, both players can **play, pause, or switch tracks in sync**

---

## 📂 Installation

1. Install via VTOL VR Mod Loader
2. Place your `.mp3` files in:  
   `VtolVR/RadioMusic/` *(on the host’s side)*
3. That’s it — copilot will receive the music automatically on mission start
